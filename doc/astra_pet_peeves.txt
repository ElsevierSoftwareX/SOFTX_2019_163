[ ] Documentation refers to *sample code* for illustration of concepts
[ ] Not explicitely checking *GPU compatibility* of geometry
[ ] Abbreviations in naming (I think only in MATLAB/Python interfaces)
[ ] Names starting with underscore are reserved, should be trailing underscore
[ ] Why not use `stdint` instead of typedefs, look up if float is guarenteed 32, may have to do with uniform cuda syntax
[ ] Can this be used as a C++ library instead of matlab/python interface? At least there are no examples
[ ] Sample should be Example? (CUDA uses sample)
[ ] Why the 'config' to create an algorithm instead of arguments? More specifically, why a 'general config' instead of setters or a factory like construct.
[ ] Uses inl files, not sure if a good or bad thing
[ ] Python examples use pylab for imaging instead of 'recommmended' OO-style plotting
[ ] Uses GPL
[ ] No 80 character line limit
[ ] 'Java' OO style instead of using more C++/STL style
[ ] Overloading function  but calling parent functions? See getInformation in algorithm(s).
[ ] no namespace scoping for constants such as 'eps', unclear where it originates
[ ] ART does not work with cpu? maybe projector incompatible
